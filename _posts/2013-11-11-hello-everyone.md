So this tweet happened.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>I wish there was a website where you could read about the websites, applications and products that didn&#39;t get built and why.</p>&mdash; Mark Boulton (@markboulton) <a href="https://twitter.com/markboulton/statuses/399884694784733185">November 11, 2013</a></blockquote>

It reminded me that I had the same idea several months back, but in video form. If you've ever seen "How It's Made", you know what I mean. I quickly abandoned the idea knowing full-well that making high quality video that people will happily watch is an expensive pass-time. That tweet though, reminded me about the end goal of sharing stories about how stuff was made.

You'll notice the date on that tweet and this post. They're the same. I wanted to get something up quickly, as I too want to read these posts, so I spun up a Jekyll blog, altered the CSS a bit and here we are!

## What?

This will hopefully be the canonical place where stories of things gone good and bad live. If you've made something, be it a website, web app, song, book, physical product, robot, vegetable garden or even a space ship, your story is a valuable one.

The only way these stories will be known is if you share them.
